# BeerReal

## Description

**BeerReal** is a social media application designed for beer enthusiasts and bar-goers.
The app checks your location, and if you’re at a bar, it will (once per hour) randomly send a notification. You’ll then have 5–10 minutes to snap a picture of your drink (preferably beer).
Your friends can upvote or downvote your drink choice, leave comments, and your overall “Taste Score” (name TBD) will reflect your drink reputation in the community.

BeerReal aims to make bar visits more interactive, fun and encourage users to discover new drinks and share their experiences in real time.
